# AI-Dynamic-Honeypot
The project integrates machine learning with a high-interaction honeypot (Cowrie) to capture attack data, extract security features, and classify threats using Random Forest &amp; Isolation Forest algorithms. A Flask API enables automated response, while a Dash-powered dashboard provides real-time attack monitoring.
